# Tutorial 1: Version Control

Programming is complicated. Managing large amounts of source code can cause all kinds of problems, expecially when collaborating with multiple developers. The solution to this is version control. Many Version Control applications exist, but none are so widely used as Git.

## Installing Git
Installing Git is pretty straightforward, the installer can be found at https://git-scm.com/downloads

The first thing you should do when you have installed Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and changing old commits later is not a simple task. Open the git bash window and use the following commands to configure these:

`$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"`

`$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`

You need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when youâ€™re in that project.

You will also want to choose a text editor for git to use as the default. Notepad++ can be configured as follows:

`git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -nosession"`

**The launch arguments -multiInst and -nosession are used to force git's instance of notepad++ to launch as a seperate instance of notepad++ to your usual instance, and to create a seperate session for git usage**

## GUI Alternatives

Git comes with an inbuilt GUI editor, but its features are fairly limited. The git process can be simplified by installing an editor of your choice, I recommend either [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), but you should browse the web to find one that fits your needs.

## Creating and Managing a Repository

Repositories can be cloned to your machine from an existing location, or created from scratch.

Creating a new git repository is simple. Once you have installed git, you will be able to navigate to any folder and use the right click menu to open a git bash window within the current folder. All you then need to do is run the command `git init`.

This will initialise a new repo within the current folder. The configuration for the repository is stored within a folder named ".git". You may need to go here if you break your repository.
